<pre>

(use 'com.ashafa.nozzle)

(def username (System/getenv "TWITTER_ACCOUNT"))
(def passwd   (System/getenv "TWITTER_PASSWD"))

(defn my-callback 
   [message] 
   (println message))

(def noz (create-nozzle "filter" username passwd my-callback))

</pre>

Nozzle is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for streaming tweets from the "Twitter Streaming API":http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Streaming-API-Documentation . Nozzle abides to the guidelines for connecting/reconnecting to the streaming api on HTTP/Network errors, or intentionally disconnecting/reconnecting/updating streams. Nozzle is also capable of changing methods and query parameters while streaming with practically no loss of data.

For documentation, please view the "API":http://ashafa.com/nozzle. It should be pretty straightforward, but if you are having any issues don't hesitate to drop me a line.

Have fun.
